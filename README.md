**Welcome to my space on the internet!**

## 🔨 About Me
- **Name**: Thiểng (or Thện if you prefer the casual Central vibes!)
- **Tech Enthusiast**: I consider myself a **Linux nerd** — especially when it comes to Ubuntu. Dual/triple boot setups are my jam!
- **Current Setup**: Dual booting Windows and macOS via OpenCore. Planning to add **Linux Mint** into the mix ✨.
- **Gamer**: I play games with a **rush-forward** strategy. Titles like **CS2** and **GTA 5** are my go-to.
- **Tech I Use**:
   - **Laptop**: Asus FX506LH (thinking of switching to MacBook Air M2 2022).
   - **Phone**: Samsung Galaxy A6 2018.
   - **Mouse**: Asus TUF M4.
- **Listening Vibes**: Knock2's music keeps me going, especially **'Dashstar\*'**. Always tweaking my **PulseEffects** to get that *'cháy'* sound.

## 🚀 What I'm Into
- **Operating Systems**: From Ubuntu tinkering to exploring Hackintosh setups.
- **Gaming**: I enjoy optimizing my setup for performance in **CS2** and **GTA Online**.
- **Audio**: Big fan of tech like **Dolby Atmos** (looking for open-source options).
- **Productivity**: Finding efficient software for video editing (CapCut-like but free).
- **Minimalism**: Always on the lookout for lightweight tools and systems (like **FydeOS** or **Batocera**).

## 📚 Fun Facts
- I like typing **'zị'** instead of **'vị'** just for the laughs 😂.
- I avoid playing games immediately after release. I usually wait **4 months** to buy them.
- Memes? My favorite is the *"everybody knows"* format.
- I’m particular about my fonts: **Oswald Bold 700** is top-tier.
- Podcasts? I prefer funny ones but nothing about cooking, please!
- **Stationery**: Comparing **Lamy** pens with **Thiên Long TL-05** because why not?

## 🛠️ My Current Projects
1. Optimizing Linux display settings: making **mirror mode** work with mismatched resolutions.
2. Exploring new overlay tools for gaming streams (similar to PlayClaw).
3. Experimenting with **OpenCore triple-booting** setups (Windows + macOS + Linux Mint).
4. Turning my **ThinkPad** into a Hackintosh machine 🌐.
